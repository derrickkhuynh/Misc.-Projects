#RADAR
This project was my capstone for my Physics 4BL Lab. Using an Arduino Uno and the HRS-04 ultrasound sensor, my team created a realtime radar system and performed analysis.

Our project was in 3 parts:
1. Calibration of the Ultrasound Sensor Speed of Sound
2. Calculate and plot objects in polar graph using matplotlib
3. Calculate the widths of objects using arclength

The RADAR.ino was self created with help from https://howtomechatronics.com/projects/arduino-radar-project/, while the RADAR.pde file is from his with minor tweaking.

The Polar_Graphs.ipynb file was entirely selfcreated and was used to calculate the widths and plots of the data, while Speed_of_Sound_Analysis.ipynb was provided by the 4BL lab TAs.
